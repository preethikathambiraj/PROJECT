#CNN MODEL TO PREDICT COVID-19
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
     The wave of Covid-19 has created a great impact to the world , as the world was not ready for this pandemic. It resulted in a rise in positive cases and a rise in death. Here we are required to predict if a person is affected by covid-19 or not by using the chest x-ray with deep learning algorithms./N
DATA SET:
     The images which are used for  training and testing the model is taken from Kaggle .The  dataset contain  chest x-ray images , of a person who is affected by covid -19 and normal chest images
TECHINICAL APPROACH:
     Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Deep Learning.
The main aim to use CNN model is, even though we have the RT-PCR test it did not give the correct prediction of covid-19 so to predict the correct result we use CNN model where we train the model with number of covid positive, normal images and test using the trained images.
